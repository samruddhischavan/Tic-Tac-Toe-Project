# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
I have created a TicTacToe game using JAVA programming Language. This Java code creates a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using a graphical user interface (GUI). It sets up a 3x3 grid where two players, "X" and "O," take turns clicking on the squares to place their marks. The game checks for a winner after each move, highlighting the winning combination or declaring a tie if all squares are filled without a winner. The interface includes a text label at the top to show the current player's turn or the game's result.
